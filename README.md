"This Sheet" means the CSS, Javascript, HTML and PHP that are included in the project hosted at https://github.com/farfromunique/vampirrePoints

"Characters" means the concepts, distribution of dots, and specific combination of choices made when using This Sheet to generate a character.

"I", "Me", "Mine" all refer to the creator of This Sheet, Aaron Coquet.

"White Wolf" means White Wolf Publishing Inc., online at www.white-wolf.com.

The general layout of This Sheet, as well as the specifics of character generation (how many points are available at each step, the names of each item that points can go into, etc)
are all Copyright White Wolf (Â© 2014 CCP hf. All rights reserved.)

The specific implementation of This Sheet, including but not limited to the HTML, JavaScript, CSS and PHP code, are Copyright 2014 Aaron Coquet

Although This Sheet is published online, for free use and / or modification by anyone, it is a requirement that it not be used for direct monetary gain

Warnings
--------
This tool is only to be used in conjunction with the above mentioned Source(s). 
While it does contain in its code and function some of the rules detailed in the Source(s), it is not intended as a replacement for them, nor is it intended as a replacement
for the character sheets created by White Wolf.

In short, I'm not giving you a listing of how the rules work, I'm giving you a tool to build a character within the rules. Please do not abuse it.
